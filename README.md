# Probabilistic-GOSPA
This repo contains the MATLAB implementation of the Probabilistic GOSPA metric

The P-GOSPA extends GOSPA into the space of multi-Bernoulli densities, incorporating inherent uncertainty in probabilistic multi-object representations. Additionally, P-GOSPA retains the interpretability of GOSPA, such as its decomposition into localization, missed detection, and false detection errors in a sound and meaningful manner.

The paper presenting the P-GOSPA is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11482.
